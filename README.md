# modeling-of-the-impulse-response-of-a-mechano-acoustical-system

The following repository contains programs written in MATLAB language, used to model the impulse response of a tuning fork. Each of them allows to calculate a chosen parameter of the fork. The acquired data was later used to describe material parameters of a three-dimensional fork model, designed in Autodesk Inventor, as a part of a CAE analysis.

All programs utilize sound signal of the fork as an input data. For this purpose, tuning fork's sound was recorded using Audacity software. Five individual signals were created and expoted to .wav format.
